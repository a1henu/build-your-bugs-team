Humans need the ability to work and provide for their families, and sometimes this means creating jobs through industries that might contribute to pollution. Those industries can just be monitored by environmental agencies. That's a win-win solution.",
			"**Student 2 (Kelly):** I see your point, Paul, but I don't think there are many industries that are so essential for the economy that their impact on the environment can be ignored or merely 'monitored.' Continual environmental damage will one day lead to the extinction of species that are essentials to agriculture. That will endanger our food chain."
