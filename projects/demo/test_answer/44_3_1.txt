The biggest mistake people make when buying tech products is focusing too much on brand or features that are not aligned with their actual needs. Many consumers get caught up in the hype of the latest gadgets or the marketing efforts of major brands, leading them to purchase products with features they don't use or even need. This mistake often occurs because people are influenced by trends, peer recommendations, or flashy advertisements, rather than evaluating how well a product fits into their specific lifestyle. In conclusion, the key to making a smart tech purchase is prioritizing functionality over brand or unnecessary features.
