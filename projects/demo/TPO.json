		"teacher": "**Professor (Doctor Diaz):** This week, we will be looking at how consumers feel about their purchases of technology. Many people find that buying devices such as mobile phones or personal computers can be very difficult. They feel like they're not prepared to make the best decision to suit their needs. In your posts, I want you to discuss the following question: What do you believe is the biggest mistake that people make when buying tech products? Explain what this mistake is.",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Claire):** I think one problem is that people don't match the product's capabilities to their actual needs. My brother just got a new mobile phone, and he is very excited about how highly rated the camera is. But he hardly ever takes photos. So he paid for a feature that he doesn't really need.",
			"**Student 2 (Paul):** When people buy a new piece of hardware, like a laptop, they often don't consider the software they are purchasing along with the hardware. If the software is not what you are used to or doesn't work with your existing files, it can be frustrating to learn a new way of using your laptop."

		"teacher": "**Professor (Doctor Diaz):** Starting this week, we will discuss how public transportation is funded. Public transportation gives people from all social groups access to their homes, workplaces, and shopping. Some argue that public transportation should be supported by tax revenue so that all people could have free access to it. What do you think? Should public transportation be free to all? Why or why not?",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Kelly):** People already pay so much in taxes for things like schools, roads, and law enforcement. I don't think that adding one more tax--especially when some people don't even use public transportation--would be a good idea. People need money for other essentials for their families.",
			"**Student 2 (Paul):** Free public transportation would result in having fewer cars on the roads. Also, it would mean cleaner air for the cities, and there are many health conditions that could be improved with cleaner air. I think the savings in health-care costs and less pollution would make it worth it."

		"teacher": "**Professor (Doctor Gupta):** This week, we'll study an issue that is often debated by economists. There are many large industries that, while providing significant economic benefits, engage in practices that result in environmental harm. Some would argue that economic success should never come at the cost of damage to the environment. Do you agree with this view? Why or why not?",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Paul):** I can't say I agree. Everyone talks about protecting natural resources, but what about protecting humans? Humans need the ability to work and provide for their families, and sometimes this means creating jobs through industries that might contribute to pollution. Those industries can just be monitored by environmental agencies. That's a win-win solution.",
			"**Student 2 (Kelly):** I see your point, Paul, but I don't think there are many industries that are so essential for the economy that their impact on the environment can be ignored or merely 'monitored.' Continual environmental damage will one day lead to the extinction of species that are essentials to agriculture. That will endanger our food chain."

If employees clearly understand what is expected of them if their leader can articulate clearly and concisely what they need to do to achieve their goals--they will be more productive and efficient in their work.",
			"**Student 2 (Kelly):** It doesn't matter how well a company's leader communicates if they don't have a deep understanding of the business itself. Employees aren't going to be motivated by a company. President who gives a great speech if it's evident that the president doesn't know what they do in their day-to-day work."

Whether in a room with sixteenth-century paintings or some moon rocks, being near fascinating objects from the past transports people out of their everyday lives. It can offer them a new perspective or a sense of possibility in their lives.",
			"**Student 2 (Claire):** Andrew makes a good point, but personally, I see greater benefit in the social aspect of museum-going. I think the biggest advantage of having a museum nearby is that people can come together for events like exhibitions and lectures or to volunteer. Museums foster a sense of community in a city. They can unite people in a common appreciation of something."

Will a time come when people stop going to cinemas entirely? Why or why not?",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Paul):** In my opinion, cinemas are here to stay. For thousands of years, people have been sharing the collective experience of watching a show, whether it was a live performance at a theater in ancient Greece or a recorded film in a cinema in todays society. And they will continue to want that shared viewing experience.",
			"**Student 2 (Claire):** I agree that cinemas are becoming obsolete, but I don't think it's because of technology. Many of the best films these days are being produced as ten- or twelve-part miniseries, with much more focus on character development. These productions are meant to be watched on television. You don't need a big screen to enjoy them."

		"teacher": "**Professor (Doctor Gupta):** This week, we'll be looking into family dynamics. One common concern in our field is that due to busy schedules, many families have limited time to spend together, so connections within families may grow weaker over time. Let's begin by discussing the following viewpoint: the best way for a family to strengthen family bonds is to work on something together, for example, cooking, gardening, or working on a craft project. Do you agree or disagree with this viewpoint? Why?",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Andrew):** I agree. Families feel more connected while working together rather than while doing passive activities, such as watching TV. While working together, family members have an opportunity to engage in an in-depth discussion and share their thoughts and feelings. Working toward a common goal, such as planting a garden, helps families create happy memories and feel a sense of accomplishment.",
			"**Student 2 (Claire):** I don't think working together is the best way for every family to strengthen family bonds because every family is different and even within one family, it is difficult to find tasks that are interesting to everyone. While working together, family members may disagree about how to best accomplish tasks, which may result in an argument."
