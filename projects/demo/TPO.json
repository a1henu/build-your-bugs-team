In your posts, I want you to discuss the following question: What do you believe is the biggest mistake that people make when buying tech products? Explain what this mistake is.",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Claire):** I think one problem is that people don't match the product's capabilities to their actual needs. My brother just got a new mobile phone, and he is very excited about how highly rated the camera is. But he hardly ever takes photos. So he paid for a feature that he doesn't really need.",

Also, it would mean cleaner air for the cities, and there are many health conditions that could be improved with cleaner air.

Even if the games are educational, the same skills can be taught in traditional ways- by reading books to children, for example. And it would be beneficial to interact with their parents in this way.", 
			"**Student 2 (Kelly):** Considering how important computers are to human societies these days, I think it actually makes sense to allow very young children to explore them. And if the computer games that children play also give them early access to subject matter that will later be taught in school, all the better."

One question facing managers is how much time and money to invest in improving the work skills of their employees. Some managers argue that ongoing employee training is the most important investment a company can make. What are your thoughts on the matter?",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Andrew):** I don't think that employee training is the most important investment a company can make. The company should be hiring the most skilled workers it can find in the first place. There are so many other unavoidable things that a company needs to spend money on that have to take precedence over training.",
			 "**Student 2 (Kelly):** Employees' leaving their jobs is always a risk, but providing ongoing training and skill development is more likely to make employees want to stay rather than go, in my opinion. When employers pay for training, employees are likely to feel more valued by their employer, and this can only improve the employer-employee relationship."

In your opinion, which is the better use for available urban space? Why?",

			"**Student 1 (Kelly):** It's true that parks can benefit people in cities, especially health-wise. But it's more important to use the limited space for things that people cannot survive without, like hospitals or clinics. Medical care is often an urgent necessity. Visiting a park is not.", 
			"**Student 2 (Claire):** I'm all for creating green spaces for people to enjoy, but you don't necessarily need an open piece of land to do that. Let the available land be used for business or housing purposes. Green spaces can be created on the rooftops of existing buildings. And new buildings can be constructed creatively to include open spaces with plants and trees."

Many recent high school graduates have taken a gap year-a yearlong break after graduation-before studying at a university. During a gap year, students may get jobs, travel, or simply relax and think about their future. Some students say their gap year was beneficial, while others regret having taken one.In your opinion, does taking a gap year create more advantages or disadvantages for students? Why?",
		"students": [
			"**Student 1 (Andrew):** The gap year would be a good opportunity for students to reflect on their education goals and confirm their plans for university. At least it would give someone time to investigate different fields and get a better sense of what it means to be in business, to work in an office, or to work with their hands,etc.",
			 "**Student 2 (Claire):** Because university can be expensive, students should not take a gap year. Tuition, the cost of books, and living expenses rise every year. The money a student might save during a gap year might not be enough to cover the rise in prices when they enter university a year later."

One solution is to improve the technology for removing salt from seawater, which could allow us to use seawater to replenish dwindling freshwater supplies.",

The obvious solution is for local governments to promote alternatives, like building bike lanes in cities or improving public transportation with electric buses. Both of these would be easy to implement as well."

Some schoolteachers give high grades (marks) only to those students who perform well on their homework assignments and tests.

Which approach do you think is better: Giving grades based only on performance, or grading students not just on performance but also on their effort?",

It wouldn't matter to me if they worked harder.",

A student who works hard, even when the final grade isn't the highest in the class, builds character, which will benefit the student later in life when they go to university or apply for a job."
